## 🔍 What the Tests Verify

### 1. Recent Improvements Are Working

**Progress Tracking:**
- Spinner correctly displays "(current/total, percentage%)" format
- Progress updates work correctly
- 100% completion is properly displayed

**Retry Logic:**
- Network errors trigger automatic retries
- Exponential backoff works correctly
- Non-network errors don't trigger unnecessary retries
- Maximum retry limits are respected

**Batch Processing:**
- Large mailboxes are processed in chunks (1000 messages at a time)
- Memory is properly cleaned up between batches (gc.collect)
- Batch ranges are calculated correctly
- Progress tracking works across multiple batches

### 2. Core Functionality Is Stable

- File and folder operations work correctly
- IMAP protocol handling is proper
- Configuration parsing is accurate
- Message ID handling is robust

## 📈 Coverage Metrics

Current test coverage focuses on:
- **Critical functions**: High priority functions have comprehensive test coverage
- **New features**: All recently added features (retry, batching, progress) are fully tested

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features:

1. Write tests first (TDD)
2. Place tests in appropriate file
3. Use pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.unit` or `@pytest.mark.integration`)
4. Run tests: `pytest`
5. Check coverage: `pytest --cov=imapbackup`

### Test Structure

```python
import pytest
import imapbackup

@pytest.mark.unit
class TestMyFeature:
    """Tests for my feature"""

    def test_feature_works(self):
        """Test that feature works correctly"""
        # Arrange
        input_data = "test"

        # Act
        result = imapbackup.my_function(input_data)

        # Assert
        assert result == expected_output
```

## 🐛 Debugging

```bash
# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Show print statements
pytest -s

# Drop into debugger on failure
pytest --pdb

# Show local variables
pytest -l
```
